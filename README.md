# Cosmic Combat: Your Favorite Space Shooter's Favorite Space Shooter

Welcome to **Cosmic Combat**, the ultimate 2D space shooter game that even other space shooters look up to. Developed as a unique project for the Fundamentals of Programming Course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), this game takes you on an interstellar journey where you battle against an array of cosmic enemies. Crafted with the [Allegro 5 game library](https://liballeg.org/), Cosmic Combat is not just a game; it's an immersive experience into programming, game development, and space warfare.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To join the cosmic battle, you'll need:
- Nothing but your enthusiasm for space shooters! The game is ready to play right out of the box.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Extract the .rar file.
3. Find and execute the `Cosmic Combat.exe` file to launch the game. No compilation needed, just straight to the action!

## For Developers and Enthusiasts: Compiling the Game

If you're inclined to dive into the source code or need to make adjustments:

- **Using CodeBlocks:** The project file `.cbp` is located in the `src` folder. Open it with CodeBlocks, and you're set to compile. If you're new to CodeBlocks, find more information on getting started [here](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads).
- **Using Other IDEs:** Ensure Allegro 5.0.x or higher is properly configured on your system. You'll need to manually set up the project in your preferred IDE and link the [Allegro library](https://liballeg.org/download.html). The source `.cpp` files are located in the `src` folder. Follow your IDE's documentation for details on compiling projects with external libraries. For Allegro's GitHub repository, visit [Allegro GitHub](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5).

## Dive Into the Cosmos

Prepare yourself for a showdown against the universe's most challenging adversaries:

- **Bomber**: Patrols horizontally, unleashing a barrage of bombs.
- **Cargo Ship**: A flying loot crate that drops health boosts, gun upgrades, or shields upon destruction.
- **Drone**: This pesky follower will chase your spaceship relentlessly.
- **Bug**: Quick and agile, capable of firing in multiple directions.
- **Warrior**: Speeds vertically across the screen, with a rapid attack rate.
- **THICCBOI**: A tanky adversary requiring significant firepower to defeat.
- **Mine**: Invisible threats that explode on contact, immune to your attacks.

## Game Highlights

- **Optimized Performance**: Enjoy seamless gameplay on both discrete (AMD and NVIDIA) and integrated GPUs. Look forward to updates for even smoother experiences.
- **Loot and Upgrades**: Enhance your ship's firepower and defenses by picking up items from downed cargo ships.

## Please Note

The game's code is a product of dedicated effort, but many of the assets used, including sprites, music, and sound effects, come from external sources. Therefore, **Cosmic Combat** is intended strictly for educational use and personal enjoyment.

## Future Updates

We're constantly working to enhance **Cosmic Combat** by bringing you new features, optimizing gameplay, and fixing any bugs. A significant update in the pipeline is the addition of a compelling **story mode**, which will immerse players even deeper into the cosmic universe of the game. This narrative will provide a rich backdrop to the battles, adding context and depth to your interstellar adventures. Stay tuned for an even more engaging cosmic experience!
